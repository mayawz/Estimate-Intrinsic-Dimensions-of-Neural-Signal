# Estimate-Intrinsic-Dimensions-of-Neural-Signal

Estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of spiking neural activity across multiple simultaneously recorded brain regions

Allow for cross-region comparison of neural dim

Compare neural acitivity trajectories across multiple event epochs and across multiple simultaneopusly recorded regions
